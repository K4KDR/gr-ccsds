    Add M-PSK Preamble

    Outputs num_syms preamble symbols, before the input stream is copied to the
    output stream. The preamble consists of alternating BPSK symbols (starting at
    1+0j) which are part of every M-PSK modulation alphabet.

    Number of Symbols: Number of preamble symbols that are generated. If this value
    is set to zero this block does nothing at all.
