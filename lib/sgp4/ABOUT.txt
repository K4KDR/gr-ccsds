The files in this folder are auxilliary files to compute satellite positions
based on two line elements (TLE).

They are based on the AIAA paper 2006-6753 "Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3" by
David A. Vallado, Paul Crawford, Richard Hujsak and T. S. Kelso available at 
https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/

The files sgp4ext.cpp, sgp4ext.h, sgp4unit.cpp and sgp4unit.h are direct copies
of the cpp implementation that is available on the link above. The files
sgp4tle.cpp and sgp4tle.h are striped down versions of the sgp4io.cpp and
sgp4io.h files from the link above, where the user input functions as well as
the prolonged TLE readings (used for the verification mode) have been removed
to allow an automated processing without any user interaction.
