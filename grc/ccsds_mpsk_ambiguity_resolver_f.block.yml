    M-PSK soft bit ambiguity resolver including Frame and Node synchronization.

    Take the softbits of an M-PSK detector (with bit ambiguity) and look for the
    attatched sync marker (ASM) in each possible ambiguity stream of the input,
    including the original input. Once the ASM is found, lock on the stream
    with tha ambiguity containing the ASM and look for the following ASMs. If in
    fully locked state a threshold number of ASM can be missing until the block
    enters search mode again.

    M: Number of modulation symbols.

    Sync Marker: Hexadecimal representation of the ASM. Must be of odd length as the
    ASM must be an integer number of bytes.

    Lock threshold: Everytime an ASM is found a counter is increased up to this
    threshold value. Everytime a ASM is expected, but did not match the counter is
    decreased. As long as the counter is larger than zero the block is in locked
    state, returning the bytes of the locked stream as output. If the counter
    reaches zero the block enters search mode again and stops it's output until it
    is locked again. Setting threshold to one will make the block loose lock
    immediatley if an exprected ASM does not match.

    Correlation threshold: Threshold for the normalized correlation between ASM and
    stream to consider both matching. A value of 1.0 means that every softbit must
    match the ASM and have highest confidence, while 0.0 means that even a sequence
    of erasures is considered as the ASM.

    Frame data length: Length of the frame data (excluding the ASM) in bytes. Every
    frame data length after an ASM another ASM is expected.
