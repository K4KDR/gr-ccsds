documentation: |-
    Reverse bits
    Copies a message from the input to the output port. Ally bytes indicated by
    "Reverse indices" will have their bit order reversed. So the old MSB will
    now be the LSB and the other way round.

    msg_length: Expected length of input and output messages in bytes. Messages
    with a different size are discarded after printing a warning.

    rev_indices: Indices of the bytes within the message that should be reversed.
    Values within this vector should be in the range from 0 to frame_length - 1.
    The default is to only reverse the first byte (0, ). (0, 2) will reverse the
    first and the third byte, etc. range(msg) will reverse all bytes in this
    message.
