documentation: "Shift input signal in order to compensate an anticipated Doppler shift\
    \ on the given centre frequency as computed by the given TLE and the given ground\
    \ station location.\n\nThe Doppler shift correction is performed in a phase-continuous\
    \ manner. The Doppler shift is computed with\nf_d(t) = f_0/c range_rate(t)\nwhere\
    \ f_0 is the centre frequency, c is the speed of light and range_rate is the relative\
    \ velocity of the satellite towards the ground station (in an ECI frame) which\
    \ is obtained by taking the time derivative of the range (distance) between the\
    \ satellite and the ground station.\n\nThe phase of each sample is offset by 2pi*\
    \ \\int_0^t f_d(\\tau) d\\tau = 2pi*f_0/c int_0^t range_rate(\\tau) d\\tau = 2pi*f_0/c\
    \ (range(t) - range(0))\nrange(0) is the computed range at the start of the block\
    \ and range(t) is the computed range for the sample that corresponds to time t.\n\
    \nThe ranges are computed from the TLE every t_u seconds. The ranges for the samples\
    \ in between are computed by linear interpolation between the two neighbouring\
    \ time points for which a range has been computed.\n\nThe blocks parameters are:\n\
    \  TLE lines: Array with the string entries from the TLE file. The array must\
    \ have a length of two or three (if the satellite name is given). The second to\
    \ last element must start with a '1' and have at least 69 characters. The last\
    \ element must start with a '2' and have at least 69 characters.\n\n  GS location:\
    \ Location of the ground station as a tuple of length 3 containing the latitude\
    \ in degrees (positive for northern hemisphere), longitude in degrees (positive\
    \ for locations east of Grenwich) and altitude in metre (above the WGS-72 ellipsoid).\n\
    \n  Centre frequency: Nominal frequency f_0 of the signal to scale the Doppler\
    \ shift correction.\n\n  Sampling rate: The sampling rate of the input (and output)\
    \ signal in Hz. The inverse of this number gives the time in seconds between two\
    \ samples.\n  \n  Update time: Compute a new range from the orbital elements every\
    \ update_time seconds.\n  \n  Block length: Process the samples in blocks of this\
    \ length. A higher block length increases the computation efficiency, but also\
    \ increases the memory requirements (16*block_len Bytes) and the output latency\
    \ (block_len/samp_rate seconds)."
