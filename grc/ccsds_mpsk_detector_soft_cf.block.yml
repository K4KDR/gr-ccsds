    M-PSK symbol detector with soft bits output.

    Take a complex input sample and detect its bit symbol. Output ld(M) floats for
    each incomming sample containing the individual soft bits where a -1.0
    represents the most confident zero bit, 1.0 the most confident one bit and 0.0
    stands for an erasure (in this case the incomming samples energy was zero).

    M: Number of modulation symbols.
