documentation: |-
    Delay locked loop (including decimator).

    Non Data aided timing estimation using the Gardner passband timing error detector and a linear first order filter. Outputs samples at symbol rate.

    Oversampling factor: Rate reduction factor between sampled intput rate and output symbol rate.

    Gamma: Filter stepsize to update the timing estimate. Smaller values will lead to smaller noise impact, but longer settling time.
